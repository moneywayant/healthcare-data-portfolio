### Heart Disease Risk Analysis

**Summary:**  
In this final project, I used a heart disease dataset and analyzed it with Excel, R (via Kaggle), and Power BI. I explored correlations between variables like cholesterol, age, gender, and heart disease diagnosis.

**Tools Used:** Excel, R, Power BI  
**Skills Highlighted:** R visualizations, multi-tool analysis, dashboard creation

**Key Features:**  
- Boxplot (age vs heart disease), cholesterol histograms  
- Correlation heatmap in R  
- Power BI dashboard with slicers and bar charts for diagnosis trends
