# Diabetes Indicators & Physical Activity Analysis

This project connects physical activity levels to diabetes indicators using BRFSS survey data. Inspired by my own academic research, the goal was to highlight preventable health risks.

**Tools Used:** BigQuery SQL, Power BI  
**Skills Demonstrated:** CTEs, CASE logic, demographic analysis

**Key Features:**
- Diabetes prevalence by activity level
- Insights filtered by age, sex, and smoking
- Custom groupings for cleaner visuals

**My Role:**  
I wrote SQL queries to analyze behavioral data, then built a dashboard to communicate key findings to healthcare decision-makers.
